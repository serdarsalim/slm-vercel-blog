TRUE,1,This blog is in PUBLIC FOLDER,first-post,A bit about me in my own words,"<p>ه&nbsp;</p><p>Hi friend!</p><p>I'm Serdar. I was born in northern Turkiye and I moved to Austria when I was 8 years old. I graduated from the University of Graz where I majored in Transcultural Communication. After Austria I moved to Ireland to work in Tech. I worked for Video Game company as a community manager for a year and then I landed my dream job at a global tech company: Twitter.</p><p>Does this blog look too much like Twitter?&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn't read on. I'm not even an avid Tweeter.&nbsp;</p><p>Working at Twitter was the best 9 years of my life. I was a Program Manager managing the onboarding and training for the agents that worked around the world. Most of the work was around content moderation but not limited to it. As a result I traveled the world and since most of our operations were in Philippines I took the opportunity and moved to Philippines.&nbsp;</p><p>After 2 years in Philippines I went back to Ireland briefly to come back to Asia again. I couldn't let go of South East Asia so fast I guess. I moved to Singapore for a year. I met my my present wife and married.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after our wedding I got fired from Twitter after 9 years. I guess I Tweeted enough.&nbsp; I needed to discover what else there is in the world.</p><p>I traveled the world with my wife and after 2 years and 25 countries I'm deeply involved in using AI, LLMS for cool things.</p><p>All my blog articles are WIP so if you check back next time. You might see a different version of this here.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>SLM</p>",SLM,2025-03-20,personal,https://unsplash.com/photos/nsMSEUHuOEU/download?ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MXxhbGx8fHx8fHx8fHwxNzQyNDU3Nzg5fA&force=TRUE&w=640,FALSE
TRUE,2,Why I invest my money rather than just saving it,personal-finance-is-important,It's important to have personal budget and investment plan for many reasons. But for one key reason you must do it!,"<p>ه</p><p>I came to realization that I need a serious budget and investment plan far too late in life. But it's never too late. You should invest in a diversified portfolio. Whatever you're making from your job won't give you the free time you deserve in this life to do the things you're really interested in.</p><p>The goal isn't making more money the goal is to having more freedom to determine what exactly to do with your short time in this world.</p><p>Unfortunately the currency of time is also to some extent the fiat currency. If you don't have it you must sometimes give your time to people and tasks that are not within your interest. So earn enough money to do the thing that aligns with your purpose. Purpose? I think that's a great 3rd post topic!</p><p>I was blessed that at least with the money I saved and some profits from my investments I was able to travel the world for 2 years. People called me #Worldtraveller when I was working @Twitter. I guess they were right.&nbsp;</p><p>With the right budget and investment plan you should be able to do what you have in your heart too.&nbsp;</p><div>I guess I'll use this blog post to also dive a bit deeper on how I learned about investing more and what I'm investing in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I do develop spreadsheets for personal finance so dive into those if you get the time.</div><div><br></div><p>As will all other posts, this post is a WIP and will be refined.</p><p>Human worker here, things go slow without AI.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>",SLM,2025-03-20,money,https://unsplash.com/photos/hpjSkU2UYSU/download?ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MXxhbGx8fHx8fHx8fHwxNzQyNDU3MjgxfA&force=TRUE&w=640,FALSE

Or it reveals the gap between what you think your purpose is and what you're actually doing. So don't procrastinate. You have limited time in this world. And there is just too much that wants your attention. I should definitely write an article about attention.</p><p>How do I spend my time these days?&nbsp; I'm giving my attention to building stuff online for myself and other people.&nbsp;Specifically Google Sheets, websites and digital content.</p><p>My goal is to help people with what I'm doing.

At least to me it's mind boggling.</li><li>I track anything that needs to be tracked over time on spreadsheets, like my weight and workouts.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>I'll add more stuff here later, this article is WIP.

There's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East. ,"<p>Hi friend!</p><p>I'm not a pacifist but I don't believe in harming civilians during a conflict. There should be no excuse to put an end to life of civilians period. I find what Israel is doing in Palestine disgusting. And they've been doing it for so long with such a strong support from Western governments it's appalling. I grew up in the West, the ideals of humanity, equality, rule of law and a life without racism is something I deeply cherish. I wish European leaders lived up to these values instead of holding those as a loose guideline only.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone who is right in their mind can see what Israel doing. They are trying to expand their territory, they are not continuing this war because of security.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=""background-color: rgb(247, 198, 206);"">What's happening there is a genocide and the world needs to see that.</span></li></ul><p>Maybe if enough people in the world come together we can stop the bloodshed.</p><p>If you're someone who's on the <span style=""background-color: rgb(247, 198, 206);"">same page with me thank you for being one and reading this blog</span>.

Yes I admit it. While I understand the concepts and have intermediate understanding of coding, most of the code I generate is with AI.

Great thing is you can learn all this by doing. Just ask the AI to teach you that stuff. Don't just copy paste. You'll learn fast and build fast.&nbsp;</p><p>We're at the exact time where you can really bring that online idea you had in your mind to reality.</p><p>That brings me to the analogy:</p><ol><li>Computers are like bicycles to our brain

I want it to feel smooth, intuitive, and easy to use, so editing posts doesn’t feel like working in a spreadsheet but more like a proper blogging platform.”</p><p class=""p1"">I use these overviews when I switch coding on it from one AI to the other so that I don't have to explain over again what I'm doing.</p><p class=""p1"">What can this blog do:</p><ul><li>It's a minimalistic designed blog where you can filter and search all blog articles very easily</li><li>Has a Google Sheets data base with built in CMS so you don't have to log in anywhere when you want to edit a post or create something new</li></ul><p><br></p><p><b>Why did I do it this way?</b></p><p>Because I hate Wordpress.
